# Next Product Hunt

Website link [Next Product Hunt](https://next-producthunt.vercel.app/).

## Summary

This is my first big application using Next, hope you liked it :), any suggestions or recommendations dm me.

## Scope

Create a web page that closely resembles the real "Product Hunt" page, be able to create products, like products uploaded by different users, and be able to leave a comment on their products.
## Functionality

This application uses Firebase to store user information and be able to make the corresponding queries, it also uses Next.js which is a technology that allows an SSR to the web page instead of a CSR. It also contains customs hooks and normal React hooks as we have seen in other projects. The application is hosted on the official website of the creators of Next.js called Vercel.
## Design

The application was inspired by the "Product Hunt" page and uses mostly styled components for styles.
